Challenge Yourself
This is what I have done So far of the Challenge yourself tasks




(1 Player character input)
-A jumping mechanic using the RigidBody component
-A crouching where the player moves slower when crouching
-A sprinting mechanic that increases the players speed
-Add a new Action Map for controller (Xbox or PS)
-Add a 3rd person camera and movement and a way to swap between 1st and 3rd person


(2 Background Sound and SFX)
-Creating a method that plays a random sound could also be useful to add some variety to the game. Example: letâ€™s say we want the player to randomly start to hum or whistle if we are standing still for more than 5 seconds. We want to randomly choose one of 3 different sounds and play it. How would you implement this? Challenge yourself!
(I added some weird sounds when you haven't moved for x seconds)

(3 Interaction)
-There was nothing to add here



(4 Pause menu)
-A main menu that connects to your main scene 
-Find a way to change the FPS of your resolution (every resolution comes with a frame rate component)
-Change the camera POV as a setting
-Try adding a mute button that mutes the game and reset the volume to the value it was before muting


(6 Animations)
-Instead of simply activating and deactivating your pause menu try animating it so it looks like it slides in and out of position


(7 Particles)
-Rain


(9 Combat System)
-Create a UI Icon which displays the cooldown on your attacks
